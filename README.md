# VR Particles

Render particles in a VR space.

## Usage
Apply Particles.cs to the main camera. This script is used to manage all the particles settings.

Apply HandInteraction.cs respectively to the right hand anchor GameObject and the left hand anchor GameObject. Is possible to setup haptic feedback for each hand. This is only available when using Oculus SDK.

## Note
Changing settings on Particles.cs may drastically impact the performance.
